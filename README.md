# About RISMiCal
The reference interaction-site model integrated calculator, RISMiCal, provide the RISM and 3D-RISM program codes with support tools for input generation and output analysis.
This package contains three types of 3D-RISM codes.
There are two types of 3D-RISM code: 3D-RISM code that runs on the CPU embedded in the RISMiCal itself and 3D-RISM code (single and multi) for GPUs provided as an external program.
